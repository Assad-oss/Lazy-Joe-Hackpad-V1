Essentially the project started as me wanting to find out more about firmware and how it can be integrated with MCUs. 
Since I had no (real) need for any macro actions, I just decided to keep my design clean & simple, creating nifty volume up-down and brightness up-down buttons. At first, I thought of using a rotary encoder for this but eventually decided against it due to finding them too small and otherwise finnicky.

Features:
  4 buttons that turn volume up, volume down, brightness up, brightness down respectively (from 1-4)
  .0.91 inch OLED, SSD1306. Programmed with circuit python to display the switch number when a button is pressed.
